- too many significant figures in K_* n_* etc 

- chandrasekhar WD equation is not really needed, but nice aside.

- beyond einstein is missing parts. you don't really sow your time evolution.
it is not clear what you mean by discretizing using leapfrog and evolving using
implicit euler.

- style: you put different tasks in different functions and files, nice modularity.
you could do some more commenting. always explain what a function does when you
define it, even if briefly.

- grade: 35/40
